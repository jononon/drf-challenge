After clicking the button on the page to start broadcasting, the page will give you a broadcast ID. Visit [https://go.jdami.co/drf-listen](https://go.jdami.co/drf-listen) in another browser **window** and enter this ID to receive the audio from the first window and visualize it in the second.

**Both the broadcast window and the visualizing window need to be visible on your screen in order for the demo to work.**
